There is a backend folder that will be handling server requests

Therre is a front end that will be able to communicate with user and display from backend && blockchain

Still contemplating if I should implement web3 into this or leave it for my next site. But stay tuned.

Feel like this is going to be different then what I wanted. Going to try and set this style up and maybe take a pause.
